These weightings are not exact (10 element selectors does not equal a class selector), it is more an idea of showing you the magnitude of each kind of selector.
Selector	Weighting
element	1
class	10
id	100
inline-style	1000
!important	10000+

What this means is that a style rule on an id is weighed much more heavily than a style rule on a class. Similarly, a style rule on a class is weighed more heavily than a rule on an element. Put another way, id rules are more specific than class rules, and class rules are more specific than element rules.

This gives us another way to differentiate between classes and ids. Not only are ids meant to be unique, unlike classes, but also ids are more specific! This is also why the background color in our example is green: the id rule trumps the class rule, which in turn trumps the element rule. Cascading only applies when the rules have the same degree of specificity; in this case, rules about specificity determine the style, not rules about cascading.

We previously mentioned that using inline styling (a <style></style> tag) can have some unintended consequences. Strong specificity is one of them! Remember that inline styling is equal to 1000 points and is far more specific than any id, class or element! Even more, using !important will override ANY styling that you have (unless you have a more specific !important) so try your best to not use it. Not only does it make it more difficult to write future CSS, but it can get complicated quickly when working with other developers. If we catch you writing !important in your CSS, weâ€™ll ask you to refactor immediately!
