<!-- Building Semantic HTML Tables

Although they are not as popular as they used to be (entire web pages used to be designed just using tables!), it’s still quite valuable to know how to build tables. They are great for displaying certain kinds of data!

<table> – This tag encompasses the entire table and wraps all of your HTML code for a table

<tr> – The table row element defines a row of cells which can include td and/or th tags

<th> – The table header tag defines a cell as the “header” for group of cells. This is traditionally placed inside of a thead tag.

<td> – The table data tag defines a cell of a table that contains some data.

<thead> – The table head tag defines a set of rows which define the columns of a table

<tbody> – From MDN:

    The HTML Table Body Element (<tbody>) defines one or more <tr> element data-rows to be the body of its parent <table> element (as long as no <tr> elements are immediate children of that table element.) In conjunction with a preceding <thead> and/or <tfoot> element, <tbody> provides additional semantic information for devices such as printers and displays. Of the parent table’s child elements, <tbody> represents the content which, when longer than a page, will most likely differ for each page printed; while the content of <thead> and <tfoot> will be the same or similar for each page printed. For displays, <tbody> will enable separate scrolling of the <thead>, <tfoot>, and <caption> elements of the same parent <table> element.

<tfoot> – The table foot tag defines a set of rows summarizing the columns of the table. -->

<!-- Building HTML Forms

    Forms are another essential part of HTML and will be used quite a bit when we get to server-side programming. We use forms to transmit data to other pages and servers.
    
    From MDN:
    
        HTML Forms are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a web site or application. They allow users to send data to the web site. Most of the time that data is sent to the web server, but the web page can also intercept it to use it on its own.
    
        An HTML Form is made of one or more widgets. Those widgets can be text fields (single line or multi line), select boxes, buttons, check boxes, or radio buttons. Most of the time, those widgets are paired with a label that describes their purpose.
    
    To get started with a form, we need a <form></form> tag and an action attribute (where the form should go when submitted). We will use # as the value of this attribute to signify that the form should not go anywhere. Forms also have another essential attribute called method which specifies how the form should be submitted.
    
    <form action="#"></form> -->
