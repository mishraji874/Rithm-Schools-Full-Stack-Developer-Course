<!-- One possible exception is the table-cell value, which can be used to vertically align an element to the middle of its container. In general, vertical alignment can be kind of a pain. But take a look at this example of an element which should be aligned to the middle of the page:
The key here is that when an elementâ€™s display is set to table-cell, it respects a new property, called vertical-align, which lets you adjust the vertical alignment of the element. Try commenting out the display properties in the two divs above, and see how that affects the layout. -->
