<!-- As you can see when you open up this page, the block-level elements both create new lines; were it not for the fixed width, they’d also take up all available horizontal space.

The inline elements don’t create new lines: they share the same horizontal space. But you should notice something else as well: even though we’re setting the width and height properties for these elements, they are only as large as the content inside of them requires! This is a general feature of inline elements: they don’t respect the width and height property. If you set values for these properties on an inline element, those values will simply be ignored.

Knowing this, let’s return to inline-block. Update the display on the last two divs in the above example so that their display is inline-block instead of inline. When you refresh the page, what happens? You should see that the last two divs now respect the width and height values! In fact, inline-block elements behave just like inline elements, except for the fact that you can set their width and height. -->
